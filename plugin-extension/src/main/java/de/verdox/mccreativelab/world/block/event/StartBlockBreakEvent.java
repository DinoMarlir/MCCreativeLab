/**
 * This event is called when a user starts damaging a block and thus starts a block breaking action.
 * Can be used to change a block hardness.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Use this with caution! The block hardness change is not synced with the player client.
 * The effect is achieved by giving the player mining fatigue when breaking a block and completely running the logic on the server.
 * However, the client may predict a block damage that is not in sync with the server.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * For example a player is breaking a stone block with an efficiency 5 diamond pickaxe.
 * The client now predicts a block damage, and maybe even breaks it client side while the server knows a different block hardness.
